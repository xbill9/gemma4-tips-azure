# Self-Hosted vLLM DevOps Agent (MCP Server)

This project provides an automated DevOps/SRE assistant that leverages **Gemma models self-hosted via vLLM on Cloud Run GPU**. It bridges Google Cloud Logging with a private inference endpoint to analyze infrastructure issues and suggest remediations.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Requirements

To deploy and run this project, you need to address two main components: the **Inference Stack** (vLLM on Cloud Run) and the **MCP Server** itself.

### 1. Infrastructure Requirements (The Inference Stack)
The MCP server expects a running vLLM instance. Your Cloud Run deployment for the model needs:
*   **Hardware:** NVIDIA L4 GPU (1 unit).
*   **Compute:** Minimum 8 vCPUs and 32GiB RAM.
*   **Execution Environment:** `gen2` (required for GPU and GCS FUSE).
*   **Storage:** A GCS Bucket containing the Gemma model weights (e.g., `gs://PROJECT_ID-bucket/nvidia/Gemma-4-31B-IT-NVFP4/`).
*   **Networking:** Private Google Access must be enabled on the VPC subnet if using GCS FUSE.

### 2. Software & API Dependencies
The agent relies on several Google Cloud services and Python libraries:
*   **Libraries:** `mcp`, `fastmcp`, `google-cloud-logging`, `google-cloud-aiplatform`, `google-cloud-storage`, `google-adk`, `huggingface_hub`, and `requests`.
*   **Permissions:** The service account running the agent needs:
	*   `logging.logEntries.list` (to read logs).
	*   `aiplatform.models.list` (to list Vertex AI models).
	*   Access to the vLLM endpoint (either public with auth or via VPC).

### 3. Environment Variables
You can configure the following variables for the MCP server:
*   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: Your GCP Project ID (defaults to `aisprint-491218`).
*   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`: The region for Vertex AI (defaults to `us-east4`).
*   `VLLM_BASE_URL`: The URL of your Cloud Run vLLM service. **If omitted, the agent will attempt to auto-discover it using `gcloud`.**
*   `MODEL_NAME`: The model identifier used by vLLM (defaults to `nvidia/Gemma-4-31B-IT-NVFP4`).

## 🛠 Usage & Setup

### Step 1: Prepare Model Weights
Use the built-in tool `get_vertex_ai_model_copy_instructions` or `get_huggingface_model_copy_instructions` to move Gemma weights to your GCS bucket.

### Step 2: Deploy vLLM to Cloud Run
Run the `get_vllm_deployment_config` tool within the MCP server to generate the exact `gcloud` command for deployment, or use the provided `Makefile`:
```bash
make deploy
```

### Step 3: Run the MCP Server
Install dependencies and run the server:
```bash
make install
# Optional: export VLLM_BASE_URL="your-vllm-url"
make run
```

## 📦 Resources
The server exposes the following MCP resources:
*   **`config://vllm-deployment-template`**: A YAML template for Cloud Run GPU deployment.

## 🌟 Grand Demo
A standalone demo script is included to showcase the agent's capabilities:
```bash
python demo_launcher.py
```
This script simulates log analysis, remediation suggestions, and infrastructure configuration generation.
